# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification
# Iris Flower Classification - CodeAlpha Internship Task 1
# Project Description
This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). This task was completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.

# Goal
The primary goal was to train a machine learning model to accurately predict the species of an Iris flower given its measurements and evaluate the model's performance.

# Dataset
The project uses the well-known Iris dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library.

# Libraries Used
pandas for data manipulation and handling.
scikit-learn for dataset loading, data splitting, model training (Logistic Regression), and model evaluation.
Model
# A Logistic Regression model was used for the classification task.

# Results
The trained Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 1.00 on the test set. The classification report shows perfect precision, recall, and F1-score for all classes on this test data.

# How to Run the Code
The code is provided in a Google Colab notebook (CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification.ipynb). You can open this notebook in Google Colab and run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis and results.

# Internship Details
